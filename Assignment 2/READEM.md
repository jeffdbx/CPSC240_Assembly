This program practices inputting/outputting arrays as well has performing 
various mathematical operations on them. The following tasks are executed:

 1. Prompt the user to input data for two integer arrays.
 2. Display both arrays.
 3. Perform vector addition on both arrays and store the result in a third array.
 4. Display the third array.
 5. Sort the third array.
 6. Display the newly sorted third array.
 7. Compute the vector dot product of the first two arrays and store the result in the third array.
 8. Display the vector dot product.
 9. Exit the program with a 'good-bye' message.
