This program practices inputting/outputting arrays as well has performing various mathematical 
operations on them. The following tasks are executed:

 1. Prompts the user to input data for two floating point arrays.
 2. Calculates the sum of each array.
 3. Finds the smallest value in each array. 
 4. Finds the largest value in each array.
 5. Calculates the arithmetic mean of each array.
 6. Calculates the sample variance of each array.
 7. Calculates the sample standard deviation of each array.
 8. Calculates the geometric mean of each array.
 9. Concatenates both arrays into a third array and repeats tasks 2 - 8 for the new array.
10. Outputs all data and calculations to the screen.
11. Exits the program with a 'good-bye' message.
